            <p>Owning a dog is not just a privilege; itâ€™s a
                responsibility. They depend on us for, at minimum,
                food and shelter, and deserve much more. When you take
                a dog into your life, you need to understand the
                commitment that dog ownership entails.</p>

                Despite their short legs, corgis are energetic dogs that require regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight and
                prevent boredom.
                They enjoy walks, playtime, and interactive toys. Training corgis can be a joy due to their intelligence and
                eagerness to please.
                Early socialization and consistent, positive reinforcement training are important to ensure they grow into
                well-behaved adult dogs.
                Corgis are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, they are prone to certain health issues such as hip
                dysplasia, degenerative
                myelopathy, and eye conditions. Regular veterinary check-ups, a balanced diet, exercise, and proper grooming are
                essential for their
                overall well-being.
